# Machine Learning Model Comparison

This project presents a comparative analysis of several widely used machine learning models for classification tasks. The goal is to evaluate the performance of each model using a breast cancer dataset and determine which one yields the highest accuracy and predictive reliability.

## 📊 Models Compared

The following models were implemented and evaluated:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Kernel Support Vector Machine (Kernel SVM)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**

Each model was assessed using confusion matrix and accuracy score metrics to evaluate its performance.

## 📈 Results

| Model                     | Accuracy Score |
|--------------------------|----------------|
| Decision Tree            | **95.90%**      |
| Kernel SVM               | 95.32%         |
| K-Nearest Neighbors      | 94.73%         |
| Logistic Regression      | 94.73%         |
| Naive Bayes              | 94.15%         |
| Support Vector Machine   | 94.15%         |
| Random Forest            | **93.56%**      |

- 🥇 **Best Model**: Decision Tree
- 🥈 **Runner-Up**: Kernel SVM
