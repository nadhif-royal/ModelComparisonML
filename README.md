# ModelComparisonML
In this project, I compare several commonly used machine learning models, namely K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Kernel SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.  I evaluate and compare the performance and accuracy of these models using a breast cancer dataset, and get the confusion matrix and accuracy score.
